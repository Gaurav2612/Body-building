                                <strong>Bodybuilding is the sport of developing one's muscles through hypertrophic exercises. 
                                    In order to achieve muscle growth, the athlete progressively overloads muscles through resistance exercises. 
                                    The sport of bodybuilding has a distinct focus on aesthetics. 
                                    There is a difference between other forms resistance training, such as Olympic weightlifting or powerlifting, and bodybuilding. 
                                    Bodybuilding competitions are not based on how much weight an athlete can lift or move. 
                                    The definition of bodybuilding is a competition in which competitors are judged on an aesthetic basis - on the size, shape, fullness, and proportions of their muscles. Modern bodybuilders often see themselves as members of a distinct subculture that has developed around the sport..

These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables.

                    Bodybuilding supplements may contain ingredients that are advertised to increase a person's muscle, body weight, athletic performance, and decrease a person's percent body fat for desired muscle definition. 
                    Among the most widely used are high protein drinks, pre-workout blends, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), glutamine, arginine, essential fatty acids, creatine, HMB, whey protein, ZMA, and weight loss products.
                    Supplements are sold either as single ingredient preparations or in the form of "stacks" â€“ proprietary blends of various supplements marketed as offering synergistic advantages.
